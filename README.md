# QAE-Dashboard

This is a dashboard for listing test and environment statuses for Tidepool Web. This is actively being developed. So, at times, things may be a bit janky. The site is responsive and for mobile devices a condensed version is shown.

Please visit [https://ginnyyadav.github.io/QAE-Dashboard/](https://ginnyyadav.github.io/QAE-Dashboard/) to see the dashboard in action.

Currently the ghost inspector badges are live and accurate up to the last test run. The environment statuses are not live currently, but will be as development occurs. This dashboard uses Bootstrap 4 components. No custom styling has been implemented yet (future).
